* Founded on June 1, 2015

* Founded in Japan and Vietnam by Daisuke Kimura and Nguyen Thanh Hai, respectively

* Main shareholders are through Mitsubishi UFJ Capital: OCPNo.1 Investment, Axa Life Insurance, More Management, Canon, Nikon, Secom, HHP Co-Creation Fund, Sousou no Tsuboi No.1 Investment

* Â¥30M capital stock


## General Business Activities:

* There are two main goals Asilla aims to achieve with its products:
    1. Leverage AI to understand and predict human behavior captured on camera, thereby activating and optimizing the potential of those spaces; for example, provide security through real-time movement analysis of potential criminals
    2. Enhance convenience for individuals who require support; for example, provide real-time analysis of crowds to detect missing child

* Asilla's intended customers appear to be large-scale commerical and industrial complexes; for example, Hankyu Nishinomiya Gardens and Fujikura's Fukagawa Gatharia. The market size of their set of customers is large, both in scale and number. Their boasted competitive advantage focuses on their system's ratio of frames per second to mean average precision percentage, combined with offering a larger amount of camera installations, resulting in more detections faster

* Asilla's current R&D front focuses on their Human Science AI Research Team (HSAR), which was established in February 2023:
    This teams aims to combine disciplies such as behavioural/criminal psychology with detection AI in order to more throughly solve dilemmas such as whether a subtle movement is human or mechnical, or to understand 'lead-up' behaviour to an event rather than only an obvious movement such as a fall
    This team is also focusing on how to combine generative AI with detection AI, in order that the above dilemmas be able to be machine-learned, thus saving time and human effort in data acquisition


## Landscape:

* Asilla is in the Behavior Recognition AI sector

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? Major trend and innovations in this sector over the past 5-10 years include:
1. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs):
    Convolution allows a neural network to measure sections of data that overlap with one another in order to create layers at a greater quantity and complexity, while recurrence allows the outputs of a neural network to recur to the inputs
2. 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks:
    These technologies allow for 3D objects to be analyzed, and for recurrence to not rely on a single hidden state, allowing a neural network to better store context   
3. Multiple modalities (e.g., video, audio, textual data) through multi-modal fusion 

* Asilla lists its major competiting technologies as Kapao, OpenPose, BodyPoseNet, and Openpifpaf


## Results: Case Study of Vladimir Putin(s?)

* Asilla was eployed as part of a report for Japanese media company TBS reporting findings on the hypothesis that Russian President Vladimir Putin employs doubles

* Asilla used its technology to do a gait analysis of various clips of the President, with its Director CTO Masahiro Wakasa reporting that "There is a possibility of a body double" because the analysis of the first two examined clips drops from a 94% match (considered to reflect that the two clips are the same person), to 86% with a third clip (below the 90% threshold which indicates the same person), with the fourth and fifth clips examined dropping matching from 75% to 69%, respectively, actually indicating the use of two body doubles, according to the report

* Asilla appears to be performing well in their domain as they are employed by major commerical and industrial complexes in Japan for security and accesibility services; as well as this case study, which shows political and information employment

* Asilla remains very small on the global scale compared to other AI imaging companies, having a capital stock of $201kUSD; their advantage seems to be in having a lack of competitors in their domestic economy


## Recommendations

* Asilla's site does not mention any financial cards/ID employments of their technology; this could be explored

* The profiles of the most successful AI imaging companies globally suggests AI imaging and security technology offered for use on things such as credit cards and IDs is very lucrative

* This technology would make use of all the above-noted technological developments in this sector expect for probably 3D CNNs since credit cards and IDs are 2D; LTSM would seem to be especially important for financial security across time and purchases

* These technologies are appropriate for this product offer because credit cards and IDs require analysis/matching of facial pictures (CNNs), recurrence would allow security across cards and IDs belonging to the same person, etc.
